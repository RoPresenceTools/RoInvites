**Welcome to Roblox Invites!**
I send invites to other server members when you join a game on Roblox, and track your playtime across Roblox games.
To add yourself to the bot, run `/user add` followed by your username and verify if needed.
To remove yourself from the current server, run `/user remove`.
To update your user info if you change your username/display name, run `/user update_info`.

**For server admins:**
Run `/settings invites` to set the channel where invites are sent.
Run `/settings announcements` to set the channel where announcements are sent.
To remove a Custom Title, run `/custom_title remove`.
To add or remove a blacklisted place ID, run `/blacklist [add | remove]`.
To save/delete snapshots, run `/snapshot [save | remove]`.
